    "Mean Purchase Amount: This represents the average spending of customers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sample Means: Calculated for each sampling method (Simple Random Sampling, Stratified Sampling, Systematic Sampling, Cluster Sampling).\n",
    "\n",
    "Median Purchase Amount: The middle value in the dataset when sorted in ascending order. It helps understand the central tendency of purchase amounts, especially useful if there are outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode Purchase Amount: The most frequently occurring purchase amount. It indicates the most common spending level among customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation and Variance: These metrics measure the spread of purchase amounts around the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates more variability in customer spending.\n",
    "\n",

    "Standard Deviation and Variance: Offer insights into the variability of customer spending, which can indicate how diverse the customer base is in terms of spending.\n",

    "\n",
    "Purchase Category Frequency: Assists in understanding customer preferences and tailoring product offerings accordingly."

    "2. SAMPLING TECHNIQUES COMPARISON\n",
    "\n",
    "SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Purchase Amount: Mean values were close to those of the full dataset, indicating that the sample is representative.\n",

    "Standard Deviation: Variability in the sample was also consistent with the overall dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visuals: The distribution histogram was similar to the full dataset, confirming good representativeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trade-Off: While straightforward and usually representative, it may not always capture specific subgroups well.\n",
    "\n",
    "STRATIFIED SAMPLING:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean and Standard Deviation: These metrics were closely aligned with the full dataset, thanks to proportional representation from each Purchase_Category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visuals: The histogram showed that the sample distribution was very close to that of the full dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trade-Off: This method ensures that all subgroups are represented proportionally, making it very effective for capturing the diversity in the dataset. However, it requires a clear understanding of subgroups and more complex implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "SYSTEMATIC SAMPLING:\n",
    "Mean and Standard Deviation: Results were generally consistent with the full dataset but could vary if there's an underlying pattern in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visuals: The histogram demonstrated reasonable alignment with the full dataset, but systematic sampling could miss patterns if they align with the sampling interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trade-Off: Simple and easy to implement but might introduce bias if there's a repeating pattern in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLUSTER SAMPLING:\n",
    "Mean and Standard Deviation: These metrics varied depending on the selected clusters. If clusters are not diverse, results might not fully represent the overall dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visuals: The histogram might show significant differences if selected clusters are not representative of the whole dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trade-Off: Useful when the dataset can be naturally grouped into clusters, but the representativeness depends on the selection of clusters."
